  <p class="hero-subtitle">Battle-tested code snippets you can actually understand</p>
</div>

## Why Vanilla Libraries?

Why depend on massive frameworks when you can **copy and paste** production-ready code that:

- ‚úÖ **You fully control** - Every line is yours to modify
- ‚úÖ **Zero dependencies** - No Maven coordinates to memorize
- ‚úÖ **Actually readable** - No framework magic or reflection gymnastics
- ‚úÖ **Modern Java** - Uses the latest Java features you're already paying for
- ‚úÖ **Stack trace friendly** - Your IDE understands what's happening

Each vanilla library is a **single, self-contained code snippet** that you drop into your project. No JARs, no versions, no transitive dependency hell.

## Available Libraries

<div class="features-grid">
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3 data-emoji="üì¶"><a href="/libraries/vanilla-result/">Vanilla Result</a></h3>
    <p>Treat errors as values instead of playing try/catch whack-a-mole. Railway-oriented programming without the framework baggage.</p>
    <p><strong>Replaces:</strong> Vavr Try/Either, Arrow-kt Result, throwing exceptions into the void</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature-card feature-coming-soon">
    <h3 data-emoji="‚ùì">Vanilla Optional</h3>
    <p>Java's Optional, but with the methods that should have been there from the start.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Coming soon (maybe)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature-card feature-coming-soon">
    <h3 data-emoji="‚úÖ">Vanilla Validation</h3>
    <p>Accumulate validation errors without drowning in nested if statements.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Coming soon (possibly)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature-card feature-coming-soon">
    <h3 data-emoji="‚ö°">Vanilla Async</h3>
    <p>CompletableFuture utilities that don't require a PhD to understand.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Coming soon (perhaps)</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Philosophy

Each Vanilla Library follows the **Vanilla DI** principles:

1. **Copy/paste friendly** - Complete, self-contained implementations
2. **Modern Java first** - Java 21+ features (records, sealed types, pattern matching)
3. **Zero magic** - No reflection, no proxies, no surprises
4. **Production ready** - Actually tested code, not just examples
5. **Framework optional** - Works everywhere Java runs

## Getting Started

1. Browse the library you need
2. Copy the code snippet
3. Paste into your project
4. ~~Read 400 pages of documentation~~ **Start using it immediately**

**That's it!** No build configuration, no dependency management, no framework lock-in.
